          <h1>Netcracker Front-end Academy</h1>
          <h3>Improve and test your developer skills!</h3>
          <li>With Front-end Academy, you can practice coding without a tutor. Your code is checked online in many ways.</li>
          <li>Our tasks are complicated as compared with other services. After them, you will be ready for projects with a mentor.</li>
          <li>Our tasks give you real-life skills which you can't get neither by doing such projects nor by preparing for exams.</li>
